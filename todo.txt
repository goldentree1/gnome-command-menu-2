Done:
 - GNOME 48
 - Submenu icons
 - Custom filepath icons
 - Change menu position (left/right/center) and indexing
 - Allow multiple menus!

Roughly done:
 - GUI for .commands.json

Todo:
 - Make .commands.json path changeable
 - Nested submenus
 - Make Menu editor GUI better:
    - Icons selector (basic general icons on most systems, provide link to more, and provide 'Browse Files...' button for personal icons)
    - Run App, Open File, OR Custom Command (current default) options for command editor??? 
      Would be nice to at least let the user see that its running ONLY a program (e.g., 'firefox' has no CLI args, so it could probably be considered just launching a program? 'nautilus xxx' is Open Dir, file is 'open xxx'?, otherwise custom command?)
    - Refresh button next to 'Edit manually'.
    - Apply Changes... remove and apply instantly? (use gsettings instead?)
 - Apply prefs changes instantly via gsettings
 - New menu item: TOGGLE (+ monitor cmd? When menu is opened, run that cmd if it exists to check if should be on or off state)
 - New menu item: Dynamic (a 'generate' cmd or something along with normal cmd. 'generate' will )

Done:
 - GNOME 48
 - Submenu icons
 - Custom filepath icons
 - Change menu position (left/right/center) and indexing
 - Allow multiple menus!
 - Menu editor GUI (a bit rough yet but fully-functional)
 - Menu templates

Potential Features:
 - Nested submenus
 - Apply prefs changes instantly via gsettings
 - New menu item: TOGGLE (+ monitor cmd? When menu is opened, run that cmd if it exists to check if should be on or off state)
 - New menu item: Dynamic (a 'generate' cmd or something along with normal cmd. 'generate' will )

TODO:

prefs.js:
X icon selector looks stupid (make lists narrower - similar to button)
X refresh button doesnt reload menus in general page (keeps deleted menus after refresh - multiple bugs stem from this!)
X 'Simple Apps Menu' should have an icon (shows up as no icon, bad look) 
X icons arent loaded when selected (at least make Choose Icon... load the icon)
X submenu doesnt have icon selector
X bugfix bad symbolic name icons on GeneralPrefsPage + commandsui
X launch default TEXT editor for 'Edit Config Manually' - not default app (defaults to firefox on ubuntu)
X clean add/remove/move menus code
X customize .commands.json path!!! (default to extension dir?)
X dont allow nested submenus in prefs menu currently (its not part of gnome...) :'-(
X more complete icon set in Icon Chooser
X link to more symbolic icons in Icon Chooser
- COMPLETE templates (description)

extension.js:
X ~/.commands.json changeable via gsettings
- fix padding issues with icon+text (also - show MISSING icon symbol when  )
- on failed parse: logError(e, this.uuid + ': Failed to load commands.json');
- better reload (dont enable/disable - might not pass review):
    reloadExtension() {
      this.cmdMenus.forEach(m => m.destroy());
      this.cmdMenus = [];
      this.enable(); // just rebuild menus, no full disable/enable cycle
    }
- cache filepath icons?

metadata.json:
- make sure works with gnome stds - dev guide extensions.gnome.org
- test GNOME 45 to try add to metadata?? more 46+47 as well

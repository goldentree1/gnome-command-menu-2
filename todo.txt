Done:
 - GNOME 48
 - Submenu icons
 - Custom filepath icons
 - Change menu position (left/right/center) and indexing

Todo:
 - Allow multiple menus!
 - Make .commands.json path changeable
 - Nested submenus
 - GUI for .commands.json ... (apparently a react web one was in development?). Editing from Extension Manager would be ideal.

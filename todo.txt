Done:
 - GNOME 48
 - Submenu icons
 - Custom filepath icons
 - Change menu position (left/right/center) and indexing
 - Allow multiple menus!

Roughly done:
 - GUI for .commands.json

Todo:
 - Make .commands.json path changeable
 - Nested submenus
 - Make Menu editor GUI better:
    - Icons selector (basic general icons on most systems, provide link to more, and provide 'Browse Files...' button for personal icons)
    - Run App, Open File, OR Custom Command (current default) options for command editor??? 
      Would be nice to at least let the user see that its running ONLY a program (e.g., 'firefox' has no CLI args, so it could probably be considered just launching a program? 'nautilus xxx' is Open Dir, file is 'open xxx'?, otherwise custom command?)
    - Refresh button next to 'Edit manually'.
    - Apply Changes... remove and apply instantly? (use gsettings instead?)
 - Apply prefs changes instantly via gsettings
 - New menu item: TOGGLE (+ monitor cmd? When menu is opened, run that cmd if it exists to check if should be on or off state)
 - New menu item: Dynamic (a 'generate' cmd or something along with normal cmd. 'generate' will )

Features:

prefs.js:
X icon selector looks stupid (make lists narrower - similar to button)
X refresh button doesnt reload menus in general page (keeps deleted menus after refresh - multiple bugs stem from this!)
X 'Simple Apps Menu' should have an icon (shows up as no icon, bad look) 
X icons arent loaded when selected (at least make Choose Icon... load the icon)
X submenu doesnt have icon selector
X bugfix bad symbolic name icons on GeneralPrefsPage + commandsui
- symbolic icons anchor link in Icon Chooser... or somewhere?
- 'Cancel Changes'... perhaps a wee re-design of prefs.js so that ogMenus is stored and more functional / better code refactor - less duplication, better use of updating menus
- can we widen the stupid adw window drag/drop box?
- customize .commands.json path!!! (default to extension dir?)
- COMPLETE templates (description)
- Command EDITOR - like not just run app dialog (change to ... icon) - multichoice menu item - 'Run App', "Open File/Folder with App...", "Custom Command"?

extension.js:
- cache filepath icons?
- is ~/.commands.json bad path (ext review)?
- on failed parse: logError(e, this.uuid + ': Failed to load commands.json');
- better reload (dont enable/disable - might not pass review):
    reloadExtension() {
      this.cmdMenus.forEach(m => m.destroy());
      this.cmdMenus = [];
      this.enable(); // just rebuild menus, no full disable/enable cycle
    }
- fix padding issues with icon+text (also - show MISSING icon symbol when  )
